We have a policy of zero tolerance for any form of abuse or harassment.

This code of conduct applies to the ComfyCon AU Discord group, YouTube page, Zoom and any other avenue of communication utilised for the community participants.  ComfyCon AU is dedicated to providing a safe space for all regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), education or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference media. Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organisers.

Show common sense and be good to each other. Put simply "Donâ€™t be a ...." 

We expect all volunteers, and participants to READ, AGREE and FOLLOW our code of conduct. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us. All moderators can be identified by @Soft Cushions or @Comfy Couch Potato
