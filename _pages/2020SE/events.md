## Incident Response Competition - in conjunction with [@retrospectlabs](https://twitter.com/retrospectlabs)
### Do you want to put your Incident Response skills to the test?
For ComfyCon 2020, we're spicing things up a little bit! For those who are interested in testing out their incident response skills, we've partnered with Retrospect Labs (who specialise in cyber security exercises), to deliver an incident response competition. <br /><br />
You'll have to work your way through an exercise that simulates a real-world incident and conduct the usual activities required within an incident response operation. This includes analysing malicious artefacts to understand what malicious activity has occurred, through to preparing media statements and briefings for senior executives. Although you can do the exercise solo, but we recommend getting a team together (maximum of 5 per a team) with a variety of different skillsets to best perform across all aspects of the incident response. <br /><br />
To select the team(s) who performed the best, we have created a panel of industry experts and thought leaders who will assess your team's performance throughout the course of the competition. The winning team will be announced during ComfyCon (with a prize too!). <br /> <br />
### Exercise/Competition Details:
* Registration is first come first serve! There will be limited availability so sign up quick!
* Teams have a maximum of 5 participants, so we recommend trying to build as diverse a team as possible! Remember, it won't just be your technical skills you need to show to win!
* Some of the activities you may need to do include: 
  * Email analysis
  * Malicious document analysis
  * Disk and memory forensics
  * Communication
  * Media talking points
  * Legal considerations
* The exercise will kick off XXXX, but it'll be self-driven so you can complete it in a day, or over the course of a week. You won't be judged for how long it takes you to complete the exercise, but on your team's ability to undertake common incident response tasks. 
* The exercise is delivered remotely, via Retrospect Labs exercise platform, so you'll be able to access all the relevant information and forensic artefacts. 

We'll be opening signups soon! As per our workshops and our training, there will be a charity donation required to sign up.

## Linux Privileged Access Training - in conjunction with [@synick](https://twitter.com/synick) and [@5ud0ch0p](https://twitter.com/5ud0ch0p)

"Attackers never stop at initial compromise; there is always an end goal objective which often requires privileged access to specific devices or systems. <br /><br />

Moving from low to high privileged access is crucial to this strategy, with various controls regularly being employed to limit the likelihood of such an attack succeeding, or increasing the effort required for an attacker to reach their goal. As security professionals, we need to understand such techniques in order to accurately assess the risk and likelihood of a given attack path within the organisation.<br /><br />

Identifying the correct privilege escalation vector can often feel like looking for a needle in a haystack, however with the right approach and understanding of the various controls in play, gaining full control can often be a safe assumption in many instances following initial foothold.<br /><br />

This course therefore will equip those likely to find themselves with an initial foothold with the skills to practically exploit a given privilege escalation vector on the Linux system. Attendees will be presented with various scenarios and methods by which full control can be achieved, supported by a virtualised set of challenges to practice and hone their techniques.<br /><br />

We will be focusing on privilege escalation in Linux, looking at both the basic scenarios and some more complex instances, as well as escaping restricted shells and execution environments.<br /><br />

Alongside a core methodology and exposure to various privilege escalation scenarios, attendees will also take away an execution environment which can be used to further hone their privilege escalation skills, and be tuned to increase the difficulty of exploitation by enabling controls commonly found in the wild and within hardened environments.<br /><br />

Specifically, the following topics will be covered:<br /><br />

Day One:
* The Linux privilege model, and the importance of root
* Basic Linux privilege escalation

Day Two:
* Escaping and bypassing restricted environments
* Complex Linux escalation"

### Exercise/Competition Details:
* Registration is first come first serve! There will be limited availability so sign up quick!
* Training will be held from 9AM to 1PM each day of the conference (Saturday the 28th and Sunday the 29th of November)
* The exercise is delivered remotely, and further details of what you may require for the training will be sent prior to the event.

We'll be opening signups soon! As per our workshops and our competition, there will be a charity donation required to sign up.
