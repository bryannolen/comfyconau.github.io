| Guide to writing IR Playbooks <br /> Incident Response playbooks are either written too vague or too detailed. One size doesn't fit all and borrowing playbooks from industry peers won't work for your out-of-box. Every organization is unique in terms of the technology stack, skilled manpower, and team structure. <br /> <br /> This workshop is aimed at equipping the participants with the analytical skill to produce playbooks for operations of any scale and complexity. <br /><br /> Interactive Exercise: We will start with a tabletop exercise, use ComfyCon discord for brainstorming response actions, and build a playbook from scratch. This activity is aimed at instilling the analytical workflow which the participants can take away and use the next day at job."|  Mustafa Qasim (@mustafaqasim) <br /> Mustafa started in IT industry 15 years ago and been working in DFIR space since 2013.
