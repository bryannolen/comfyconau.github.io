        <td><b>Guide to writing IR Playbooks</b><br/><br/> Incident Response playbooks are either written too vague or too detailed. One size doesn't fit all and borrowing playbooks from industry peers won't work for your out-of-box. Every organization is unique in terms of the technology stack, skilled manpower, and team structure.<br/><br/> This workshop is aimed at equipping the participants with the analytical skill to produce playbooks for operations of any scale and complexity.<br/><br/> Interactive Exercise: We will start with a tabletop exercise, use ComfyCon discord for brainstorming response actions, and build a playbook from scratch. This activity is aimed at instilling the analytical workflow which the participants can take away and use the next day at job.</td>
        <td><b>Mustafa Qasim (@mustafaqasim)</b><br/><br/>Mustafa started in IT industry 15 years ago and been working in DFIR space since 2013. He worked as Network Engineer and Unix Sysadmin before pivoting into Incident Response and Digital Forensics. He has built a Managed Security Services division from ground up, orchestrating professional services including Security Operations Center, Incident Response, Penetration Testing, and Incident Readiness. He is passionate about teaching and loves to make analogies that help explain&nbsp; technical concepts in plain English.</td>

        <td><b>Build-a-bot - Creating a bot to beat a WAF and SOC.</b><br/><br/>In this workshop we'll dig into the process of creating a HTTP Bot from scratch, designed to bypass the most finely tuned WAFs and subvert WAF alert triaging to go unnoticed. In this session you'll have the opportunity to implement your own location aware proxy service for your bot to hook into, dynamic HTTP header generation to avoid ever sending the same request twice, mimicking legitimate human traffic and creating a smokescreen to divert the attention of the SOC.<br/><br/>This workshop will require access to a code editor, have a fair understanding of JavaScript in the context of NodeJS, and the ability to install NodeJS.</td>
        <td><b>Sam Crowther (@infosecsam)</b><br/><br/>I'm an entrepreneur with a passion for cybersecurity. I got my start in the security industry as a high school student when I had the opportunity to work with the team at the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). From there, I moved to a red team role at a global investment bank, an experience that inspired me to start my own company. I love creating simple technical solutions to complex problems and am motivated by challenging preconceived ideas.</td>

        <td><b>Learn how Networks work with WireShark.</b><br/><br/>A 100 level workshop to demonstrate how devices communicate over network interfaces, typically using Ethernet and TCP/IP.<br/><br/>Demonstrating how you can view contents of cleartext packets, how encryption affects network transmission, how you can view the full communication of a network transmission and more.<br/><br/>Learn how to install and configure WireShark on your own workstation.<br/><br/>Learn some really simple tricks you can use in pcap analysis tasks in Capture the Flag events.</td>
        <td><b>George (@georgecoldham)</b><br/><br/>George loves sharing what he knows in the hope that it helps others grow and improve. His career spans both education and technology and now works as a consultant at Empired.</td>

        <td><b>Mental Health Threat Modeling</b><br/><br/>In the field of cyber security, we talk about threat modeling as a process of how we can design systems to become more secure by looking at potential threats. The phrase has also been used in the context of personal threat modeling in terms of how we can practice having better opsec to protect our physical security. But we haven&rsquo;t really talked about how we can use threat modeling to help safeguard our mental wellbeing. This talk will cover how we can use safety plans from the realm of mental health practices to create our own mental health threat models. Participants will be given time to think about their potential risk factors. At the end of the talk, the speaker hopes that the participants walk away with a draft of their own mental health threat models.</td>
        <td><b>Gyle (@GyledC)</b><br/><br/>Before switching to the tech field, Gyle trained as a psychologist. While in the university, she used to joke that there seems to be an invisible blinking signboard above her head that says &ldquo;All ye needing solace and comfort, talk to me.&rdquo; This persisted when she got into the interwebs via her trusty 56k US Robotics modem, where she used to hang out in IRC chat rooms. Currently, aside from finding bad stuff as a Cyber Threat Analyst, she volunteers for various causes. She&rsquo;s also an accredited Mental Health First Aider and if it wasn&rsquo;t for the pandemic, she would go for the instructor course to help train more people. So getting selected to do this talk is her way of reaching out to others who maybe struggling.</td>

        <td><b>Real-World Cryptography</b><br/><br/>Have you ever wondered how all the cryptographic magic we use every day works? Then this workshop is for you!<br/><br/>Aimed for people with little prior knowledge, Eleanor will discuss the theory behind some of the most widely-used cryptographic tools today, including AES, ECDH, ECDSA, and message authentication codes. They will then give you the opportunity to use these tools to solve some workshop problems in Java or Python, giving you some hands-on experience to relate the theory to practice. Eleanor will be at hand to guide you through anything you get stuck on.</td>
        <td><b>Eleanor (@noneuclideangrl)</b><br/><br/>Eleanor is a Master's student at the University of Melbourne researching applied cryptography. They are interested in almost everything, but especially security &amp; privacy, and the methods to achieve them in real-world scenarios. They like cats, tea, karate, and role-playing.</td>
