# What is ComfyCon AU?
ComfyCon AU was originally constructed as a conference in March 2020 as a response to the cancellation of Cyber Security conferences due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

# Who is involved with ComfyCon AU
Firstly, we have a lot of amazing speakers from across Australia and New Zealand.

We also have a group of great volunteers who look after both the conference, but also the Discord channel long term. These include:
- (@goatindex)[https://twitter.com/goatindex]
- (@benzies)[https://twitter.com/benzies]

Special thanks to "Cyber Mum" [Lidia](https://twitter.com/pink_tangent) who is also our mentor for these events.

And finally, the crazy ideas and overall runnning of the event is conducted by [Iain Dickson](https://twitter.com/wan0net), [Shanna Daly](https://twitter.com/fancy_flare) and [Andrea Lewis](https://twitter.com/MissAndyL)
