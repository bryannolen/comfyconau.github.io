### What is ComfyCon AU?
ComfyCon AU was originally constructed as a conference in March 2020 as a response to the cancellation of Cyber Security conferences due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

### Who is involved with ComfyCon AU?
Firstly, we have a lot of amazing speakers from across Australia and New Zealand.

We also have a group of great volunteers who look after both the conference, but also the Discord channel long term. 

#### Comfy Couch Potatoes
The crazy ideas and overall running of the event is conducted by [Iain Dickson](https://twitter.com/wan0net) and [Shanna Daly](https://twitter.com/fancy_4n6).

We also recognise the contributions of Andrea Lewis, an original Comfy Couch Potato and brain child as well as the designer of our much loved ComfyConAU logo and potato.

Special thanks to "Cyber Mum" [Lidia](https://twitter.com/pink_tangent) who is also our mentor for these events.

### Can I watch past presentations from previous ComfyCon AU conferences?

You certainly can, the recordings from the previous ComfyCon AU conferences are available on the ComfyConAU [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ComfyConAU) channel.

### When will the next ComfyCon AU conference be held?

The best place to find out about the next conference is on the ComfyConAU [Twitter](https://twitter.com/comfyconau) feed, or join the discord channel (invite details below).

### How can I submit a presentation for consideration at the next ComfyCon AU?

Call for papers will run prior to each conference and open calls for papers can be found [here](/call-for-papers.html).

### What if I've never talked at a conference before?

Then you will be perfect for ComfyConAU. We are happy to provide mentorship for any speakers who'd like assistance from the CFP stage right through to presenting on your chosen topic. Join Discord and reach out to one of the Comfy Couch Potatoes.
