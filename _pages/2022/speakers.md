    <td><b>Deus Ex Promised Me Cool Augments, and All I Got Was Dystopia: When Do I Get My Robot Legs, and Will They Get Hacked?</b><br><br>How do we attach augments? What body systems will they replace and enhance? What are the current technical challenges involved in augmentation? Much of the current news and talk around augmentation feels like elaborate marketing. This talk will aim to give a snapshot of the current state of augmentation technology, exploring some of the emerging types of augments, how they work, and what still needs to be solved before you can get one.</td>
    <td><b>Alex Bek (<a href="https://twitter.com/thembo_sec">@thembo_sec</a>)</b><br><brAlex is a biomedical engineer, currently working on the cybersecurity of the medical device. They have a background across many aspects of the healthcare system, and the devices and implants that enable us to live happy and healthy lives. They have a keen interest in how health security intersects with economic, social, and systemic factors when working to deliver the best possible outcomes for patients.</td>

    <td><b>A Deep Dive into Winning Infosec Using Stickiness and Oiliness</b><br>Last year at the AISA conference, I presented on 8 essential ways of doing infosec - what I called the "More-Essential Essential-8". In the talk, I noted that each of the "ways" could use more detail and this talk is a deeper dive into the one I called "Oiliness and Stickiness".

I believe that by organisations embracing the concepts of oiliness and stickiness, they can leverage corporate culture to increase the effectiveness of the information security department beyond what the department can achieve on its own. 

I will present some practical examples that I have seen and how these have helped. 

I will also give some first steps that can be taken immediately in order to get started with embedding this culture into your organisation. </td>
    <td><b>Allen Baranov (<a href="https://twitter.com/abaranov">@abaranov</a>)</b><br><br>Born in Africa and now stranded on a desert island (Australia, mate), Allen is the worlds only AAA-rated GRC Hacker. Coming from a technical background (networking, linux, firewalls), Allen is now a Manager-level GRC Consultant, working at CyberCX and advising clients on the details of risk and compliance but also the larger picture of how to build a successful infosec/cyber security program. 
Allen has presented at DEF CON Blue Team Village, DEF CON Security Leaders Village, PCI and AISA but the most exciting talks are the ones he has presented for ComfyCon.</td>

    <td><b>Survival Guide: Remote Work Edition</b><br><br>With the rapid move to online or digital spaces due to the pandemic and lockdowns, a lot of organisations and teams found themselves rapidly adopting remote work. As many organisations rapidly transition to the new remote normal, some did so better than others. As remote fundamentally changes interpersonal dynamics of work, it is important to learn to identify the good from the bad early on, as bad situations can often quickly snowball. Here are anonymised real stories, lessons and strategies learned to identify, and manage the situation, in the hope that from these experiences we create a healthier and better remote-work experience for the infosec community.</td>
    <td><b>GyledC (<a href="https://twitter.com/GyledC">@GyledC</a>) & hoodiePony (<a href="https://twitter.com/hoodiePony">@hoodiePony</a>)</b><br><br>hoodiePony is your friendly local Security Architect & Pentester and is quite involved with the local infosec community, while GyledC is your blue teamer with a purple team mindset who volunteers for a bunch of community stuff. Pre-COVID, they first met face-to-face at various community events & found out that they both hang out online in different community chats. Both are passionate advocates of sharing stuff they learned with others and by doing this talk together, they would like to help others to not just survive working in the cyber security industry but to also thrive. </td>
